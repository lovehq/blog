####Everything starts with a "Hello world"####

I read two articles a couple of days ago:

- [Why software engineers should maintain a blog](http://server.dzone.com/articles/why-software-engineers-should)

- [9 Things I Learned as a Software Engineer](https://medium.com/@maebert/9-things-i-learned-as-a-software-engineer-c2c9f76c9266)

So basically this is why I'm starting this blog. I hope it can give me the motivation to think and learn.
